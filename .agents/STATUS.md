## Skills (`.agents/skills/`)

| Skill | File | Status | Trust | Tested | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Launch Experiment | `launch-experiment.md` | 🟡 Draft | Low | ❌ | Needs dry-run validation |
| Monitor Experiment | `monitor-experiment.md` | 🟡 Draft | Low | ❌ | Requires W&B API access to test |
| Summarize Run | `summarize-run.md` | 🟡 Draft | Low | ❌ | Pattern from existing test infra |
| Log Experiment | `log-experiment.md` | 🟡 Draft | Low | ❌ | Journal formatting only |
| Evaluate Video Quality | `evaluate-video-quality.md` | 🟡 Draft | Low | ❌ | SSIM section most mature |
| Index Related Work | `index-related-work.md` | 🟡 Draft | Low | ❌ | Schema defined, no entries yet |
| Search Related Work | `search-related-work.md` | 🟡 Draft | Low | ❌ | Depends on indexed entries |
| Skill Template | `SKILL_TEMPLATE.md` | ✅ Ready | High | ✅ | Meta-template, stable |

### Trust Level Definitions
- **High**: Tested in production, validated against real experiments
- **Medium**: Logic is sound, partially tested or based on existing patterns
- **Low**: Newly written, not yet validated
- **None**: Placeholder only

## What to Do Next

1. **Validate skills**: Run a minimal training experiment using the
   `experiment-lifecycle` SOP to test `launch-experiment` → `monitor-experiment`
   → `summarize-run` end-to-end.
2. **Index first related work**: Use `index-related-work` to add at least one
   paper (e.g., the Self-Forcing paper used in the codebase).
3. **Capture first lesson**: After the validation run, capture any findings.
4. **Promote to Ready**: As each skill/SOP is tested, update its status here.
